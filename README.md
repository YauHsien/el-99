# el-99
My solutions of Ninety-nine Lisp Problems (L-99) in Emacs-Lisp

### Problem Sets
See the page https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems

### Usage
1. Use the command `git clone https://github.com/yauhsien/el-99.git` to get a clone of this project.
1. Install `emacs` if you does not have it; install `NTEmacs` if your OS is Microsoft Windows.
1. Launch `emacs` and load the file `el-99.git`. (Use `Ctrl-x Ctrl-f` key-chord to send "Open File" command to `emacs` and type the path of the file `el-99.git` in your machine.)
1. In `emacs` you'll see the file which is loaded with `Emacs-Lisp Mode`, according to the file extension `.el`. Choose `Emacs-Lisp > Evaluate Buffer` in the menu bar to make sure that the code in `el-99.el` is evaludated by `emacs`, then all `elisp` functions will be available.
1. Location cursor to the end of any `elisp` statement / expression / sentence and type another key-chord `Ctrl-x Ctrl-e`, then see the result of evaluation in the `mini buffer`.
